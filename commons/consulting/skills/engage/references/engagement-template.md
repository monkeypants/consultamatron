## Notes for agents

- Project slugs follow the convention `{skillset-prefix}-{n}`:
  `maps-1`, `maps-2`, `canvas-1`, etc.
- The engagement plan is a proposal, not a commitment. The client
  negotiates before anything is created.
- Cross-project references are informational suggestions. Skills read
  across project boundaries only when the project brief explicitly
  references another project.
