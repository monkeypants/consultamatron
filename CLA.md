### 2. Copyright Assignment

**(a)** At the time the Contribution is Submitted, You assign to the
Maintainer all right, title, and interest worldwide in all Copyright
covering the Contribution.

**(b)** To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2(a) cannot
be assigned by You to the Maintainer, You grant to the Maintainer a
perpetual, worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
irrevocable licence under such non-assigned rights, with rights to
sublicence through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to practise such
non-assigned rights, including, but not limited to, the right to
reproduce, modify, display, perform, and distribute the Contribution.

**(c)** To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2(a) can
neither be assigned nor licensed by You to the Maintainer, You
irrevocably waive and agree never to assert such rights against the
Maintainer, any of the Maintainer's successors in interest, or any of
the Maintainer's licensees, either direct or indirect.

**(d)** Upon such assignment of rights to the Maintainer, to the
maximum extent possible, the Maintainer immediately grants to You a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
irrevocable licence under such rights covering the Contribution, with
rights to sublicence through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to
reproduce, modify, display, perform, and distribute the Contribution.
The intention of this section is that You retain the ability to use
Your own Contribution for any purpose.

**(e)** The Maintainer is not restricted in how the Contribution may
be licensed. As the copyright assignee, the Maintainer may license
the Contribution under any terms, including but not limited to the
Project's current licence (GNU General Public License, version 3 or
later), other open source licences, proprietary licences, or dual
licensing arrangements. Contributors should understand that by
assigning copyright, they grant the Maintainer unrestricted
discretion over licensing.

### 3. Patent Licence

For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and
apparatus claims which You own, control, or have the right to grant,
now or in the future, You grant to the Maintainer a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable
patent licence, with the right to sublicence these rights to multiple
tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,
import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution
in combination with the Material (and portions of such combination).
This licence is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the
licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and if the Maintainer
assigns these patent rights to a third party, the third party shall
also be bound by this licence.

### 4. Representations

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
assignment and licences. If Your employer(s) has rights to
intellectual property that You create that includes Your
Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has
waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project, or that
Your employer has executed a separate agreement with the Maintainer.

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
creation (see Section 6 for submissions on behalf of others). You
represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details
of any third-party licence or other restriction (including, but not
limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are
personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
Contributions.

### 5. Disclaimer

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 4, THE CONTRIBUTION IS
PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO THE MAINTAINER
AND BY THE MAINTAINER TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES
CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE
MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

### 6. Consequential Damage Waiver

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
YOU OR THE MAINTAINER BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF
ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
RESULTING FROM YOUR CONTRIBUTION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION IS
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 7. Third-Party Contributions

Should You wish to Submit work that is not Your original creation,
You may Submit it to the Project separately from any Contribution,
identifying the complete details of its source and of any licence or
other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,
trademarks, and licence agreements) of which You are personally
aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of
a third party: [named here]".

### 8. Miscellaneous

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of **Australia**,
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. Under certain circumstances,
the governing law in this section might be superseded by the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
("UN Convention") and the parties agree that the UN Convention shall
not apply to this Agreement. The parties agree to attempt to resolve
any disputes in good faith before pursuing formal legal proceedings.

This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and the
Maintainer for Your Contributions to the Project and overrides all
other agreements or understandings.

If You or the Maintainer assigns the rights or obligations received
through this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the
assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all
the rights and obligations in the Agreement.

The failure of either party to require performance by the other party
of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall not affect
the right of a party to require such performance at any time in the
future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation
shall not be considered a waiver of the provision itself.

If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable,
such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a
provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision
and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose
of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent
possible under law.
