# Research Strategies

Strategies for organisation research. The agent selects one based on
initial signals about the organisation's public presence, then
elaborates specific research tasks from it. The operator agrees the
strategy and tasks before research begins.

## Strategy selection

Assess these signals before proposing a strategy:

- **Corporate website**: Exists and substantive, or placeholder/absent?
- **Press coverage**: Meaningful coverage in the last 24 months?
- **Job postings**: Present on major platforms?
- **Regulatory filings**: Public financial records or regulatory filings?
- **Information consistency**: Do sources agree, or suggest a recent
  pivot or rebrand?

Use these signals to select a strategy. If uncertain, propose your
reasoning and let the operator decide.

## Standard research

**When to use**: Organisation has a substantive public presence — a
real website, press coverage, job postings, or regulatory filings.
Most established organisations qualify.

**Research tasks**:

1. **Corporate Overview** — mission, vision, strategy, structure,
   size, history, milestones, recent news (last 12 months).
   Sources: corporate website, Wikipedia, annual reports, press releases.

2. **Products and Services** — product/service portfolio, customer
   segments, pricing models, recent launches/discontinuations,
   stated value proposition.
   Sources: product pages, marketing material, press releases, review sites.

3. **Technology Landscape** — technology stack, platforms,
   infrastructure, build vs buy decisions, technology partnerships,
   patents, research publications.
   Sources: job postings, engineering blogs, conference presentations,
   patent databases, GitHub organisation.

4. **Market Position** — competitors, market share, industry
   classification, market size, competitive advantages, industry trends,
   analyst coverage.
   Sources: industry reports, news coverage, analyst notes, financial filings.

5. **Regulatory Environment** — applicable regulations, regulatory
   bodies, compliance requirements, recent regulatory changes,
   certifications.
   Sources: government websites, regulatory body publications, industry
   standards bodies, compliance documentation.

6. **Partnerships and Suppliers** — key partnerships, major suppliers
   and vendors, supply chain structure, outsourcing arrangements,
   joint ventures.
   Sources: press releases, annual reports, partner directories, SEC filings.

**Adaptation**: The operator may add, remove, or modify tasks during
strategy negotiation. These six are the default set, not a fixed
requirement. The agreed strategy determines what gets researched.

## Market landscape

**When to use**: Stealth-mode, pre-launch, or early-stage
organisations with minimal public presence. Two or more of: no
corporate website, no press coverage, no job postings, no regulatory
filings.

**Approach**: Research the market the organisation operates in rather
than the organisation directly. The organisation's position is
inferred from the negative space.

**Research tasks**:

1. **Market Structure** — market size, segmentation, growth dynamics,
   major players, value chain structure.
2. **Competitor Landscape** — direct and adjacent competitors, their
   positioning, strengths, gaps.
3. **Technology Trends** — dominant and emerging technologies in the
   space, build vs buy norms, platform dependencies.
4. **Regulatory Landscape** — regulations affecting the market,
   compliance barriers to entry, recent regulatory changes.
5. **Customer Problems** — unmet needs, pain points, switching costs,
   buying behaviour in the market.
6. **Organisation Fragments** — whatever is available about the target:
   founder backgrounds, patent filings, domain registrations,
   conference appearances, early hiring signals.

## Recent pivot

**When to use**: Public information contradicts itself because the
organisation has recently changed direction. Sources disagree on what
the organisation does or who it serves.

**Approach**: Separate sources by date. Research the pre-pivot and
post-pivot states independently. The pivot itself is a structural
finding.

**Research tasks**:

1. **Pre-Pivot State** — what the organisation was before the change:
   products, market, positioning, technology.
2. **Pivot Signals** — when and why the change happened: leadership
   changes, market shifts, funding events, public statements.
3. **Post-Pivot State** — current direction: new products, new market,
   new positioning, new technology choices.
4. **Continuity Assessment** — what carried over: retained capabilities,
   existing customers, infrastructure, partnerships.
5. **Market Context** — the market the organisation is pivoting into
   (use market landscape tasks as sub-structure).

**Note**: Flag which sources reflect pre-pivot vs post-pivot reality.
Date every claim.

## Operator-mediated briefing

**When to use**: The operator has direct access to principals
(founders, executives) and can provide internal documents or conduct
interviews. Typically for clients where the operator has an existing
relationship.

**Approach**: The operator provides the core information. The agent
structures and synthesises it into the standard report format. Public
research fills gaps around the operator-provided core.

**Research tasks**:

1. **Operator Briefing** — structured interview or document intake
   from the operator. Cover: organisation mission, products, users,
   technology, competitive position, constraints.
2. **Gap Identification** — compare briefing against the standard
   research task list. Identify what the briefing didn't cover.
3. **Public Research** — fill gaps using public sources. Focus on
   areas the operator didn't cover or where independent verification
   adds value.
4. **Cross-Reference** — verify operator-provided claims against
   public sources where possible. Flag discrepancies.

## Sub-report format

Every research task produces a report following the template in
[research-template.md](research-template.md):

- Every factual claim must have a citation with URL
- Include a confidence level (High / Medium / Low) with reasoning
- Include a "Strategic Relevance" section connecting findings to
  potential strategic insights
- Use direct quotes where possible
- Each report must reference at least 3 distinct sources
