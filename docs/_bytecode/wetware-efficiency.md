Wetware efficiency optimises the operator's scarce resource — cognition. The operator fills three irreplaceable dyad roles: sensor (reads socio-economic signals the model cannot access), actuator (takes real-world action), insight generator (synthesises judgment across inaccessible information sources). All three improve with understanding.

Cost model parallels token economics: cognitive load (4 chunks working memory), attention fatigue (depletable budget, front-load judgment-requiring material), background knowledge debt (vocabulary gaps force translation effort at every encounter — paying debt down reduces per-interaction cost permanently).

Pedagogy as compounding investment: the operator learns across engagements, the LLM does not. Every unit of understanding is a permanent improvement to dyad capability. Teaching through the work: make reasoning visible in proposals, name concepts canonically, show evidence chains. The propose-negotiate-agree loop is a pedagogical mechanism.

Comprehension enables negotiation — without it, the operator rubber-stamps (collapses the quality gate to single-agent system with human latency). High-resolution feedback requires domain fluency. The graduation gradient: calibrate pedagogical scaffolding to operator fluency level, detected from negotiation resolution quality.
