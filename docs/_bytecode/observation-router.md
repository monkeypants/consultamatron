Design specification for capturing observations at natural inflection points and routing them to the right knowledge context. Five-stage pipeline: inflection point → reflection strategy → observations → classification → routing. Key design split separates high-freedom observation (context-dependent judgment) from low-freedom routing (mechanical tag-based dispatch). Reflection strategy bags are per-inflection-point-type and grow with practice experience. Currently iteration 0 — general pattern documented, accumulator items not yet extracted.
