DDD context map analysis of the practice/skillset boundary. All eight Evans strategic relationships are observable: the practice layer is an Open Host Service (published protocol, no bilateral negotiation); skillsets are Conformists with Customer-Supplier influence (accept upstream entity schemas, influence via PRs); `resources/` is a small explicit Shared Kernel (immutable after agreement); skillsets follow Separate Ways (no inter-BC dependencies, enforced by doctrine test); per-skillset research skills are Anti-Corruption Layers (translate external mess into semantic pack format); the propose-negotiate-agree loop is a Partnership at the human-agent boundary.

Each of the twelve capabilities maps to one or more DDD relationships. The context map diagnoses integration friction: Conformist friction (need schema change), Shared Kernel friction (format conflicts), missing ACL friction (raw data leaking), Separate Ways violation (cross-BC imports).
