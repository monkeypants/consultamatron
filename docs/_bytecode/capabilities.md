Catalogue of twelve integration facets at the practice/skillset boundary. Each capability describes a port the practice layer defines and the adapter contract a skillset must satisfy. Capabilities decompose the Consultamatron Integration Protocol by the Parnas criterion — each hides one independently varying design decision.

Five code ports (zero-token, CI-enforced): pipeline-declaration (SKILLSETS with ordered PipelineStage entries, mature), gate-inspection (GateInspector protocol derives state from artifact existence, mature), deliverable-presentation (ProjectPresenter assembles workspace artifacts into ProjectContribution, mature), service-registration (register_services on DI container, established), conformance-testing (doctrine test framework and fixtures, established).

Five language ports (filesystem conventions, token-burning verification): knowledge-packs (semantic pack convention with dual-audience access, established), knowledge-protocols (typed items with use-case-specific contracts, nascent), research-strategies (domain-specific information-gathering descriptions, nascent), analysis (jedi council selects luminaries from pantheon for multi-perspective synthesis, nascent), pedagogic-metadata (docs/ pack structure as concept catalogue for graduation gradient, nascent).

Two undefined-mechanism capabilities: iteration-evidence (feedback channel from reviews to rs-assess, nascent), voices (alternate communication styles for analytical output, nascent).
