The semantic waist routes all engagement bookkeeping through a narrow typed layer: entities, repositories, use cases, DTOs, CLI. Seven write use cases, six read use cases — every bookkeeping operation passes through one of thirteen operations. Typed (Pydantic), validated (business rules), cheap (zero tokens).

Solves context diffusion: convergent conclusions crystallise into structured data at each waist point (the design double diamond), so subsequent divergence starts from concentrated signal. Gate artifacts at waist points are the deterministic backbone — `.agreed` suffix marks the nondeterministic/deterministic boundary. Immutable after agreement.

External artifacts (decision logs, gate files, engagement logs) serve as cross-session memory — agents reconstruct state from structured data rather than re-mining prose. The waist enables skill composition: skills that have never heard of each other compose through the single source of truth.

Boundary: the waist captures lifecycle data (that things happened), not content data (what was produced). DDD vocabulary applies: `resources/` is a Shared Kernel, gate schemas are Published Language, per-skillset research skills are Anti-Corruption Layers, the `engage` skill is an executable Context Map.
