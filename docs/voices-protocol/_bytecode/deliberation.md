Jedi council (Weinberg, Cockburn, Brooks, Beck, Evans, Larman, Anthropic) on whether Consultamatron should adopt multiple pedagogic voices. Consensus: the idea addresses a real gap — one delivery channel for a scarce resource (operator cognition) that documentation says should not be wasted. Voice is an output adapter, not an analytical modifier; it never changes the analysis.

Divergence on weight: Beck argues prompt pattern first (YAGNI), Evans argues proper bounded context, Brooks argues proportional machinery. Resolution: two-phase approach — (1) prompt pattern now ("explain that like Feynman"), (2) protocol with semantic pack items when evidence warrants (characterisation drift, preference persistence needed).

Key constraint: Protected Variations — voice layer is a pure transform, no side effects on analytical artifacts. Gate artifacts remain analytical; voice output is derivative.

Subsequent deliberation (pedagogic-gradient-descent) refined recommendation: voice selection should be a function of concept gap, evidence level, and operator preference — not blanket preference.

Includes in-character explanations from Feynman (same physics, different lecture hall), Garden (bedside manner vs diagnosis), and Krieger (delivery mechanism vs compound).
