  Deliberation on whether Consultamatron should adopt multiple pedagogic
  voices for operator comprehension. Explores the idea through hexagonal
  architecture, YAGNI, DDD bounded contexts, and essential-vs-accidental
  complexity. Consensus: start as a prompt pattern, promote to a protocol
  when evidence warrants.
