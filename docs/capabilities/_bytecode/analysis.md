The analysis capability connects luminaries to problems through the jedi council use case. Skillsets supply a `type: pantheon` pack with luminary entries (contribution description + invocation trigger). The practice layer selects 5-7 relevant luminaries via `_bytecode/` summaries, reads full items for those selected, invokes each perspective, synthesises consensus and divergence, and cites every framework used.

The token efficiency mechanism is critical: 16 luminaries compressed to summaries for selection, 5-7 expanded to full items for analysis. Progressive disclosure applied to analytical selection.

Supporting vocabulary (patterns, principles, anti-patterns) is cited by name during perspective invocation, not pre-selected. Output is a deliberation with per-luminary sections, synthesis, and a council sources table serving as the pedagogic mechanism.

Verification: no structural tests yet. Shape tests would verify `type: pantheon` frontmatter, H2 sections, minimum luminary count. Contract verification would evaluate invocation trigger specificity. Maturity: nascent.
