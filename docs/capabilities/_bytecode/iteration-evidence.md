Iteration evidence is the feedback channel from engagement execution to skillset improvement. The review skill produces findings; the rs-assess pipeline consumes them. The channel between these does not yet exist as a structured capability.

Three missing components: (1) a feedback channel depositing review findings somewhere rs-assess can discover across sessions; (2) an evidence register in each BC accumulating operational evidence with structured entries; (3) a fitness function catalogue with evaluable predicates about skillset quality.

The boundary test determines where evidence flows: methodology knowledge feeds rs-assess inside the BC; platform knowledge raises a GitHub issue. Currently findings are written to client workspaces (gitignored) and evaporate when engagements end.

Mechanism: undefined. Discovery: not defined. Maturity: nascent.
