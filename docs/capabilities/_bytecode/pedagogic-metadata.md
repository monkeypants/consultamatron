Pedagogic metadata reuses the docs/ knowledge pack convention. A skillset's docs/ pack is simultaneously reference material and pedagogic structure: `_bytecode/` tree is the concept catalogue, items are the concepts, nesting encodes learning dependencies.

The practice layer provides graduation gradient detection: low-resolution negotiation feedback indicates low fluency (increase scaffolding), high-resolution indicates high fluency (reduce to conclusions and evidence). Three pedagogic affordances: make reasoning visible, name the concepts using canonical vocabulary, show the evidence chain.

The docs/ pack is the adapter — no new convention needed. What does not yet exist is the practice-layer machinery that consumes this structure pedagogically.

Pedagogy as compounding investment: operator understanding persists across engagements while LLM context does not. The docs/ pack grows as the skillset matures, enriching the concept map. Maturity: nascent.
