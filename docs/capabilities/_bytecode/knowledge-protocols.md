A knowledge protocol emerges when a practice-layer use case processes typed items structurally. The protocol bridges "typed item in a pack" and "item a use case can consume." Three-layer architecture: convention (PackItem: name, type), use case (domain contracts), adapter (markdown with frontmatter).

Four domain-generic protocols recur across consulting domains: pantheon (contribution + invocation trigger, consumed by jedi council), patterns (problem + solution + application trigger), principles (statement + provenance + application trigger), anti-patterns (surface appeal + damage + diagnostic trigger). Same protocols apply across SWE, restaurant management, supply chain — different content.

Promotion criterion: a topic becomes a protocol when a practice-layer use case matches on its type. Before promotion, items are reference material with a type label.

No structural tests yet. Contracts are documented but not enforced. Maturity: nascent.
