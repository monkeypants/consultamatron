Voices are alternate communication styles for analytical output — the same analysis delivered through different cognitive pathways. Currently a prompt pattern only ("explain that like Feynman"), not a structured capability.

Promote to a protocol when: voice characterisation drifts across sessions, consistent profiles needed, preference persistence required, or domain-specific voices (not in training data) are needed.

When promoted, voices would be a separate BC from the pantheon protocol. A luminary has ideas (analytical); a voice has communication style (delivery). The voice layer is a pure transform — Protected Variations requires absolute insulation of analysis from delivery. Gate artifacts are always analytical, never voice-repackaged.

The two-stage persona pipeline: luminaries analyse (frameworks applied to problem), then a voice explains (synthesis adapted to operator's brain). Maturity: nascent.
