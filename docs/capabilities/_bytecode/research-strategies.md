Research strategies are domain-specific intelligence about how to learn about a subject. Skillsets supply strategy descriptions in `references/research-strategies.md` (or a knowledge pack). Each strategy describes applicability conditions, prescribed tasks, and expected output structure.

The practice layer provides execution mechanisms: web search, structured output (semantic bytecode hierarchy L0-L3), operator-mediated briefing, and the propose-negotiate-agree loop for strategy selection.

Example strategies for org-research: standard research (substantive public presence), market landscape (stealth/emerging), recent pivot (contradictory information), operator-mediated briefing (direct access). ns-research would supply different strategies for methodology domains.

Currently the weakest integration point. No discovery mechanism, no verification. Research skills read strategies by hard-coded reference path. Maturity: nascent.
