Two jedi councils plus operator negotiation on calibrated operator pedagogy.

**Council 1: Operator knowledge modelling.** Weinberg: model knowledge through observed interaction patterns, not self-assessment. Cockburn: learning needs analysis at per-gate level using actor-goal model. Cunningham: background knowledge debt is compound-interest technical debt — prioritise high-interest cheap-to-service debts. Beck: three-state model (unknown/familiar/fluent), TDD feedback loop for knowledge. Evans: OperatorProfile as cross-engagement aggregate with event-sourced evidence. Brooks: minimal model, match resolution to decision resolution. Anthropic: lightweight artifact, bytecode-compressed, profile is prior not constraint.

**Council 2: Evidence architecture.** Append-only evidence log separated from assessment (Parnas: recording and assessment change for different reasons). Evidence types grow with experience (tricks knowledge base). Feathers: characterisation tests for knowledge — record what is observed, not what is expected. Evans: event sourcing with CQRS — write model (evidence log) separate from read model (assessment projection). Cunningham: temporal dimension enables spaced repetition and evidence depreciation. Beck: record deliberate observations not ambient signal; voice objective is evidence advancement.

**Operator negotiation corrects council on:** voices are strategies not adapters (strategy selector pattern); four fluency states not three (unknown, familiar/overconfident, familiar/knowingly-ignorant, fluent); multiple feedback loops (negotiate, skillset, engagement, preparation/rehearsal, reflective); differential debt consequences (skillset utilisation vs engagement finishing); concept identity decoupled from tree position; gatepoint-triggered signal extraction not continuous; semantic index with early termination for context loading.

**Amended architecture:** Cybernetic control loop (measure → compare → compute gradient → step → re-measure). Five trees with shared concept identity: skillset concept tree, engagement research tree, operator evidence tree, artifact skillset salience tree, artifact research salience tree. Evidence at `personal/knowledge-evidence/{source}/{skillset}/{concept}/`. Progressive compression over time. Assessment is computed projection, not stored.
