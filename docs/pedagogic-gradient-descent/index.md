name: pedagogic-gradient-descent
purpose: >
  Design specification for calibrated operator pedagogy. Models operator
  knowledge as a cybernetic control loop: measure understanding, compare
  against requirements, compute the steepest learning gradient, and step
  downhill with targeted pedagogic strategies. Develops four fluency
  states, append-only evidence architecture, differential debt
  consequences, and multiple feedback loops.
actor_goals:
  - actor: platform engineer
    goal: understand the evidence-of-understanding architecture before implementing
  - actor: skill author
    goal: know how to record fluency evidence and calibrate pedagogic delivery
  - actor: operator
    goal: understand how the system tracks and addresses knowledge gaps
triggers:
  - designing the operator knowledge model
  - implementing evidence recording in skills
  - building the pedagogic calibration system
  - reviewing operator fluency across engagements

# Pedagogic Gradient Descent

Design specification for calibrated operator pedagogy. Two jedi council
deliberations develop the architecture; operator negotiation corrects
and extends.

## Items

- `deliberations.md` — two councils plus operator negotiation: knowledge
  modelling, evidence architecture, four fluency states, differential
  debt, teaching strategy selection, concept identity decoupling
