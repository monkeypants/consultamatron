Extracted accumulator items from iteration-0 and established the security model through operator refinement and two deliberations.

**Needs-driven observation.** Operator reframed the model: destinations declare information needs (like actor-goals for sensory apparatus), CLI aggregates needs into a brief, skills apply the brief to transient context. Replaces observe-then-classify-then-route — observations made in response to declared needs already carry their destination. Needs compress naturally through deduplication across same-skillset and same-client engagements.

**Negotiate loop is multi-scope.** Not limited to pedagogic observations — all four domains are available at negotiate loops because the agent has deep loaded context.

**Routing security.** Operator corrected council's permissive consensus: routing is information transfer, not noise. Ineligible destinations are data leaks — catastrophic, trust-destroying. Deny-all, allow-some. Three destination classes: personal (greedy — always eligible), engagement-scoped (allow per config), commons (dark channel only via GitHub #23).

**Beck-Larman testing deliberation.** Test the aggregator not the observation. Five-test pyramid from type-level need declaration through CLI integration. Test through use case interface not file format.

**Six accumulator items produced:** general-pattern, inflection-point-taxonomy, observation-needs-protocol, observation-routing-split, routing-security-model, software-changes.
