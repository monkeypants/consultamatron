Updated software-changes spec from vague sketch to concrete specification grounded in existing platform patterns.

**Added:** Design constraints section (markdown+frontmatter storage, actionability principle, deny-all security). Concrete entities: `ObservationNeed` (slug, owner_type, owner_ref, level, need, rationale, lifecycle_moment, served), `RoutingAllowList` with `RoutingDestination`, `Observation` (slug, source_inflection, need_refs, content, destinations). Repository protocols: `NeedsReader` (type_level_needs, instance_needs) and `ObservationWriter` following `@runtime_checkable Protocol` pattern. Three use cases: `AggregateNeedsBrief` (5-step flow with duplicate flagging), `RouteObservations` (mechanical dispatch with allow list verification), `ReviewNeedsHygiene` (four failure modes). Needs lifecycle support with distributed declaration moments. Needs evolution support with within-engagement self-feeding and cross-engagement promotion.

**Expanded:** Skill changes — skills write new needs as evolution side effects. Review gains promotion role. Gatepoint gains self-feeding evolution. Engagement configuration surface unchanged — routing policy derives from existing config.
