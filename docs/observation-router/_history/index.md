# Observation Router — Iteration History

Agents: read bytecodes (most recent first) for context on how the
accumulator items evolved. Each iteration compressed by agreed strategy
at close of the knowledge-iteration cycle.

## Items

| Item | Iteration | Key contribution |
|---|---|---|
| `iteration-3.md` | 3 | Software-changes spec rewrite grounded in existing architecture |
| `iteration-2.md` | 2 | Worked example, needs lifecycle/evolution/hygiene, guiding principle |
| `iteration-1.md` | 1 | Needs-driven model, routing security, accumulator extraction |
| `iteration-0.md` | 0 | Origin session, jedi council, general pattern discovery |
