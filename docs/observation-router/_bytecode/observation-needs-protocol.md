Protocol: every observation destination declares its information needs. Analogous to actor-goals in pack manifests — destinations are actors with goals for sensory input. Inheritance model: type-level generic needs (all clients need stakeholder dynamics; all skillsets need what-worked/what-didn't) plus instance-level specific needs (a particular client's pecadilloes). CLI aggregation use case gathers relevant type+instance needs from all destinations, synthesises into a brief the skill consumes. Skill just asks for the brief — no knowledge of destinations, types, or inheritance required. Replaces the vague "bag of tricks" with concrete declared needs owned by destinations. Needs declarations live with their owners; exact format unspecified, convention is what matters.
