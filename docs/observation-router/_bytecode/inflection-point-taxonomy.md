Four inflection point types. Three cross-context, one local. At each, the agent requests an observation needs brief shaped by inflection type and relevant destinations.

**Engagement review:** deliberate, comprehensive. Full brief from all destinations. Catches what opportunistic observation missed. **Gatepoint:** opportunistic, lightweight. Full brief available but applied only to what surfaced during gate negotiation. Side channel — must not slow negotiation. **Negotiate loop:** multi-scope. Full brief; operator understanding needs naturally prominent but client/methodology/practice needs served by substantive negotiation content. Pedagogic gradient descent is one strategy here, not the only one. **Pack-and-wrap:** content-focused, local only. Pack declares its own compilation-time needs (structural integrity, cross-references). Does not participate in cross-context routing.
