Four inflection point types. Three are cross-context (observations route to any domain); one is local.

**Engagement review** — deliberate, comprehensive reflection post-engagement. All four observation domains equally prominent. Catches what opportunistic observation missed.

**Gatepoint** — opportunistic, lightweight reflection during gate artifact negotiation. Captures context-rich signal while transient context is loaded. Any domain may surface.

**Negotiate loop** — multi-scope reflection during propose-negotiate-agree. Operator understanding naturally prominent but client, methodology, and practice observations surface during substantive negotiation. Pedagogic gradient descent is one applicable strategy, not the only one.

**Pack-and-wrap** — content-focused reflection during bytecode compilation. Local routing only (observations about the pack itself). Quality maintenance during routine operations.

Each type has an independently growing "bag of tricks" — type-specific questions worth asking at that moment. Bags not yet specified; grow through practice experience.
