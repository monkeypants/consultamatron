Four-stage needs-driven observation pattern: inflection point → needs brief → observations → routing. Agent arrives at an inflection point (transient rich context about to be lost), requests aggregated observation needs brief from CLI, applies brief to context using judgment to extract observations serving declared needs, routes observations to destinations whose needs they serve. Routing is nearly mechanical — needs carry their origin, collapsing the earlier classify-then-route step. Key insights: destinations are expert on their own needs (needs-driven, not observe-then-classify); observation is high-freedom judgment, routing is low-freedom dispatch; the needs brief mediates between them.
