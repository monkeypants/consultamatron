Specification sketch for platform changes. New: observation needs protocol — type-level and instance-level need declarations living with their owners; format unspecified. New: CLI `practice observation-needs` use case aggregating relevant needs into a brief. Skill changes: each inflection point skill gains a step — request needs brief, hold alongside context, apply after primary work, output observations. Review applies full brief comprehensively. Gatepoint applies brief lightly as side channel. Negotiate loop applies across all domains including pedagogic. Pack-and-wrap local only — pack declares own compilation needs. Routing infrastructure: accepts observations, dispatches to need-identified destinations, handles fan-out, extensible via need declarations not routing logic changes. Unchanged: client workspace structure, pack convention, engagement lifecycle, integration surface, propose-negotiate-agree loop.
