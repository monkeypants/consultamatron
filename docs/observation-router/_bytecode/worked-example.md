End-to-end trace through a fictional engagement gatepoint (segments.agreed.md negotiation). Demonstrates all four stages of the pattern against a scenario with three projects (BMC, consulting, wardley-mapping).

Routing table built by deny-all/allow-some: personal/ yes, client workspace yes, all sibling projects within engagement yes (engagement is the trust boundary, not the project), commons/ denied (dark channel only). Needs gathered from type-level (driven by "what can we improve?") and instance-level (client procurement preferences, funding-round signals, cross-project segment assumptions). Needs deduplicate naturally — same skillset across multiple contexts collapses.

Agent extracts three observations from one operator remark about segment rejection: client observation (sponsor procurement speed criterion → workspace), project observation (political not structural constraint → canvas-1 + maps-1), methodology observation (BMC should distinguish "bad fit" from "client constraint" → personal/ skillset). Each routed to destinations whose needs it serves.

Open questions surfaced: instance-level needs authoring (operator vs agent vs both), brief size at scale, observation granularity (one per destination or one with fan-out).
