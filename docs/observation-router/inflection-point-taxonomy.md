# Inflection Point Taxonomy

Four inflection point types have been identified. Three are
cross-context (the needs brief can include needs from any
destination). One is local. The difference between the cross-context
types is the character of the context available and which needs are
most naturally served, not which destinations are reachable.

At each inflection point, the agent requests an observation needs
brief. The brief is shaped by the inflection point type (which
determines what context is available) and by the specific destinations
relevant to the current engagement.

## Engagement review

- **Trigger:** Post-engagement review skill execution
- **Context character:** Deliberate and comprehensive. The agent has
  reviewed the full engagement. All topics are in scope.
- **Needs brief scope:** All relevant destinations contribute needs.
  The review is the comprehensive sweep — the brief is at its
  fullest here.
- **Role:** Catches what opportunistic observation missed. Ensures
  no declared need goes unserved.

## Gatepoint

- **Trigger:** Any gate artifact negotiation within a skillset pipeline
- **Context character:** Opportunistic and lightweight. The agent
  holds context from the negotiation that just completed.
- **Needs brief scope:** All relevant destinations contribute needs,
  but the agent applies them only to what surfaced during
  negotiation. The brief focuses attention; the available context
  constrains what can be observed.
- **Role:** Captures context-rich signal in the moment. The
  observation is made while the relevant context is still loaded —
  engagement review would have to re-derive it.

## Negotiate loop

- **Trigger:** Operator negotiation within the propose-negotiate-agree
  loop
- **Context character:** Multi-scope. The operator is actively
  engaging with material, so pedagogic signals are naturally
  available. But the negotiation itself surfaces substantive
  insights — pushback on a strategy map position might reveal
  client constraints or expose a methodology gap.
- **Needs brief scope:** All relevant destinations contribute needs.
  Operator evidence tree needs are naturally prominent (the agent
  directly observes how the operator engages with concepts), but
  client, methodology, and practice needs are served by the
  substantive content of the negotiation.
- **Role:** The agent has deep loaded context during negotiation —
  the needs brief ensures that depth is exploited across all
  destinations, not just the one the negotiation is nominally about.

## Pack-and-wrap

- **Trigger:** Bytecode compilation of a knowledge pack item
- **Context character:** Content-focused. The agent deeply reads
  content during compilation — a natural moment to notice structural
  issues, stale claims, or missing cross-references.
- **Needs brief scope:** Local only. The pack itself declares what
  it needs observed during compilation — structural integrity,
  cross-reference validity, summarisation strategy fitness.
- **Routing:** Local. Observations act on the pack itself (flag for
  author, adjust summarisation strategy) rather than routing to
  external destinations.
- **Role:** Quality maintenance during routine pack operations.

## Structural summary

| Inflection point | Context character | Needs brief | Routing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engagement review | Deliberate, comprehensive | All destinations | Cross-context |
| Gatepoint | Opportunistic, lightweight | All destinations | Cross-context |
| Negotiate loop | Multi-scope, substantive | All destinations | Cross-context |
| Pack-and-wrap | Content-focused | Local pack only | Local |
