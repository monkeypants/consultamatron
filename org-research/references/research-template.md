## Notes for agents

- Every factual claim must have a citation.
- Use direct quotes where possible, with page/section references.
- If a source contradicts another, note the conflict explicitly.
- "Confidence" is about the quality of evidence, not the importance of the topic.
- Keep each sub-report focused on its assigned topic. Cross-references
  to other sub-reports are encouraged but detail should not be duplicated.
