All client-identifying information must be removed before publishing.

## {Finding title}

### Observation

{What was observed, described generically. No client names, product
names, person names, or identifying details.

Example: "During a Wardley Mapping engagement with a services company,
the wm-chain skill produced supply chains that..." — not "Jim's Group's
scheduling platform supply chain..."}

### Impact

{How this affected the engagement outcome. Quantify where possible
using generic measures: revision cycles, stages affected, time spent
on manual work. Do not include financial figures that could identify
the engagement.}

### Evidence

{Structural evidence that supports the observation. Reference skillset
stages, artifact types, and process steps — not client-specific files.

Example: "The evolve stage required 4 revision cycles because..." —
not "clients/jims-mowing/projects/maps-1/evolve/assessments/ contained
6 drafts..."}

### Recommendation

{Specific, actionable change. Name the skill, the step, and what should
be added or changed.

Example: "wm-chain Step 3 should cross-reference the research index
for supplier information before constructing dependency trees."}

### Context

- **Skillset**: {e.g. Wardley Mapping, Business Model Canvas}
- **Stage**: {e.g. wm-chain, bmc-segments}
- **Engagement scale**: {e.g. single project, multi-project}
- **Category**: {process-fix / skill-gap / new-capability}

## Sanitisation Checklist

Before publishing, verify each finding against this checklist:

- [ ] No organisation name or obvious identifier appears
- [ ] No product or service names that could identify the client
- [ ] No person names appear anywhere
- [ ] No financial figures that could identify the engagement
- [ ] Industry description is generic (e.g. "services company" not
      "lawn mowing franchise")
- [ ] Geographic references are removed or generalised
- [ ] The structural observation survives without client context
- [ ] The recommendation is actionable for someone who has never seen
      the client workspace
- [ ] Example artifacts reference generic paths, not actual client paths
